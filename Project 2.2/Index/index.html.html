        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Longo argues that the objectivist, subjectivist,
            and logical accounts of probability are insufficient in solving “the problem of induction” --
            how we can meaningfully predict the future based on the past -- and argues instead for an account
            of probability based on normative equilibrium. This view asserts that we subscribe to predictive
            hypotheses about the future in order to coordinate our behavior with others towards shared interests.
            However, Longo believes that the logic of the neoliberal market
            -- that incentives informational asymmetry -- prevents us from ever reaching such
            a normative equilibrium and instead imposes a state of permanent uncertainty as market
            actors constantly try to know more than their competitors. Predictive hypotheses reinforce
            certain behaviors that become the input for other predictions resulting in other behaviors
            that in turn become predictable and so on ad infinitum. <br /><br />
            Below, you will find a map of a reading. Above, there are links to more in depth explorations of each of the probability theories. I reccomend clicking on the "The Neoliberal Horror" only after you have firm grasp of the other topics. You may click on the head, "Reading Map" for a full page display.
