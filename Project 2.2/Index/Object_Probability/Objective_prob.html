        <h2>Objective account of probability</h2>
        <p> The objective account probability is probably the most intuitive to understand. A prediction based on the objective account takes into account one thing: the frequency of past occurrences. If I throw a coin up in the air an infinite number of times, the probability of it landing on heads or tails will approach 50%. Longo gives a similar example, that of a dice being thrown a large number of times. The probability of obtaining any given number will be ⅙. </p>
        <br /><p>There is an issue with this account, however: it requires that an event be reproducible. Events that do not occur often enough do not generate the necessary data to make predictions under the objectivist account. For instance, the first time Haly’s comment was recorded in the written record, we couldn’t predict when it would come again: it was only after a certain number of occurrences that we could say with any certainty when it would come again. Longo gives the example of natural disasters that are, in many instances, by definition anomalous. How are we to predict them with the objectivist account of probability, then? Short answer: we can’t. Longo thus rejects this account as insufficient. </p>
